# Portfolio Website Skeleton

## Overview

This is a simple, stylish single-page portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The site is designed to be a clean template for showcasing your skills, projects, experience, and contact information.

## Structure

- **index.html**: Central file that loads all sections.
- **style.css**: Main stylesheet for layout and design.
- **main.js**: Loads each section dynamically into the page.
- **sections/**: Contains separate HTML files for each section:
  - `navbar.html`: Floating navigation bar
  - `main.html`: Intro section
  - `skills.html`: Skills list
  - `projects.html`: Projects showcase
  - `experience.html`: Experience details
  - `contact.html`: Contact form

## Technical Details

- **Modular Sections**: Each section is split into its own HTML file for easy editing and reuse.
- **Dynamic Loading**: JavaScript fetches and injects section HTML into the main page.
- **Styling**: Uses modern CSS for a clean, floating navbar and card-like sections.
- **No Frameworks**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JS for simplicity and performance.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Edit the section files in `sections/` to add your own content.
3. Customize styles in `style.css` as needed.

## Next Steps

- Add your real content to each section.
- Enhance interactivity and animations as desired.
- Make the site fully responsive for all devices.
